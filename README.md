MCP Weather Server and Anthropic Chat Client

In this example, we will build a simple MCP weather server and have an Anthropic chat client connect to the weather server.

We will build a server that exposes two tools:
- `get-alerts`
- `get-forecast`

Additionally, we will build a Claude LLM-powered chatbot client that connects to MCP servers.
